## 1. Installation

Just download the the file shurtcuts into the roaming folder of your computer. It is usually located in `c:\Users\yourname\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\` where `yourname` refers to the username. 

## 2. How to use it
Two main functionalities:

### 2.1. Select code between marks to send to Stata
with this function you are able to select only the text between two marks without using the mouse to scroll down/up or the pgUp or PgDn keys. Instead you just have to create the Starting Point (\*##s) and the Ending Point (\*##e), by using the shortcuts Ctrl+Alt+Z and Ctrl+Alt+A, respectively. Each time you create a new Starting or Ending Point, the previous marks will be deleted from your script. Then, you only need to use the shurtcut Ctrl+Alt+Q to select the code that is between you marks and press your personal shortcut to run code in STata (in my case it is F9). 

### 2.2. Add section and subsection dividers

By using the shortcuts Ctrl+Alt+1 and Ctrl+Alt+2 you can create section and subsection dividers to organize your code. 

### 3. Changing shortcuts

You may change the chortcuts of this files by clicking in `Macro`>`Modify Shurtcut/Delete Macro`.
